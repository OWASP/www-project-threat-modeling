## Threat Severity Classification Framework

Adapted from the Microsoft SDL Bug Bar. This framework is used to triage and classify threats against our systems, services, and devices. Severity is assigned based on the nature of the threat, the context in which it can be triggered, and the degree of user interaction or authentication required.

When a lower-severity threat class can be combined with by-design behaviour to achieve a higher-severity outcome, the threat is rated at the higher class.

## General Principles

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Unauthenticated / anonymous | The attacker has no valid credentials or established session |
| Authenticated | The attacker holds valid credentials for the target system |
| User interaction | A legitimate user must take an action (click, open, visit) for the threat to succeed |
| Extensive user interaction | User must navigate deliberately, e.g. manually typing a URL or clicking through multiple warning dialogs. Clicking an email link does not count as extensive |
| Persistent | The effect survives a restart of the application, service, or system |
| Temporary | The effect is reversed by restarting the application, service, or system |
| High-value asset | Domain controllers, certificate authorities, identity providers, HSMs, core CI/CD infrastructure |
| OTA | Over-the-air: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other wireless communication channels |
| PII | Personally Identifiable Information: any data that can identify an individual, either directly (e.g. name, national ID, biometrics) or indirectly when combined with other data (e.g. location history, device identifiers, behavioural patterns) |
| Confidential / Restricted data | Data formally classified as confidential or restricted by the organisation's data classification policy, regardless of whether it constitutes PII |

## Server / Cloud and Client Threats

The **Context** column indicates which environment(s) the row applies to. Where both contexts share the same category and severity level, examples are split inline. For **Auth Required** and **User Interaction**, values are noted per context where they diverge.

- **All** — applies to both Server / Cloud and Client
- **Server / Cloud** — on-premises servers, virtualised infrastructure, and cloud-hosted services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, multi-tenant APIs)
- **Client** — browsers, desktop applications, mobile/store apps, and processes running in a local interactive user session

## Hardware Threats

**Key terms:**

- **OTA** — Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or other supported wireless channels
- **External device** — any device connected via an external port, including PCIe/Thunderbolt, displays, and batteries (excludes CPUs, RAM, power supplies)
- **Expected user interaction** — actions required to use a legitimate version of the attacking device type (plugging in, pressing a button, using a paired app)
- **Unexpected user interaction** — any action beyond expected interaction

| Severity | Threat Category | Auth Required | User Interaction | Security Impact | Conditions & Examples |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Critical (4)** | Unauthorised Access / Privilege Escalation | No | Expected only | Code Execution / Full Compromise | OTA drive-by attack requiring only expected user interaction; attacker needs only to be within wireless range. Example: malicious Bluetooth peripheral achieves RCE on the host with no more interaction than the user having Bluetooth enabled. |
| **Important (3)** | Unauthorised Access / Privilege Escalation | No | Unexpected · Expected | Privilege Escalation / Code Execution | OTA attack requiring unexpected user interaction. External device connected (with or without any interaction) executes code at a higher privilege level than the triggering user. External device with expected interaction executes code in the user's own context. |
| **Important (3)** | Denial of Service | No | Expected only | Availability Loss | OTA drive-by DoS with expected user interaction only; attacker within wireless range. |
| **Important (3)** | Data Exfiltration / Info Disclosure | No | Any | Confidentiality Loss | External device (any interaction) leaks data back to the attacker. OTA attack (any interaction) leaks data from a more privileged context to the attacker. |
| **Moderate (2)** | Unauthorised Access / Privilege Escalation | No | Unexpected | Code Execution (same context) | External device with unexpected user interaction executes code in the same context as the interacting user (no privilege gain). |
| **Moderate (2)** | Denial of Service | No | Unexpected | Availability Loss | OTA attack requiring unexpected user interaction. |
| **Low / None (1)** | Denial of Service | No | Required | Availability Loss (minor) | External device connection causing DoS that does not meet the Important or Moderate definitions above. |

## Severity Summary Reference

| Severity | Colour | General Definition |
|----------|--------|--------------------|
| **(!) Critical (4)** | Red | Wormable, unauthenticated, or unavoidable full compromise. No user interaction required, or interaction is trivial (e.g. previewing a file). |
| **(x) Important (3)** | Orange/Amber | Significant compromise possible in common scenarios, typically requiring authentication, user interaction, or mitigations that reduce but do not eliminate risk. |
| **(*) Moderate (2)** | Blue | Limited-scope or non-default scenarios; mitigations exist; effect is recoverable or constrained. |
| **(i) Low (1)** | Green | Minimal security impact; typically untargeted, non-sensitive, or fully temporary. |
